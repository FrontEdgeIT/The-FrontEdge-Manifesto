# The-FrontEdge-Manifesto
This manifesto was created to break down what it means to be an IT-Consultant working for FrontEdge IT. The foundation is our core values of happiness, agility and professionalism, inspiration by both the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the manifesto for Software Craftsmanship

FrontEdge IT’s core business is being absolute experts within the broad field of software development, we value passion for self-improvement and the ever-burning flame of curiosity for new Technology. An IT consultant at FrontEdge should always aim to reach a higher understanding when it comes to software development (Dev) and its operations (Ops).

We are Craftsmen, proud of our craft which we fine-tune to perfection. We help our fellow colleagues at FrontEdge to become stronger, more competent programmers, by sharing our knowledge amongst eachother. 

Rather than asking – “what’s in it for me”, we focus on “how can I help”. With that attitude, great possibilities, responsibilities and opportunities will follow automatically, or if you prefer automagically.  

We are value-focused, never forgetting that someone pays us for what we do and expects us to perform and deliver quality and value. Its up to each consultant to make sure that the customer is satisfied and that we create and deliver true value to our end-users. It’s a natural part of our agile way of working to gain understanding of purpose and business value by talking to our peers (customers/end-users/project managers etc.). Courage is an important part of our character, and we should never be afraid of questioning decisions and keep asking questions to gain a true understanding, only then can we deliver the greatest value.
